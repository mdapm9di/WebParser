# WebParser

At this point in development, I decided to remove the description from README.md for convenience, and not be distracted by editing the application's changelog. When the first release of the application appears, I will make a description

As of September 17, 2025, some buttons on the left panel don't work, only theme changes. Translation of the application, a link to GitHub, and settings will be added, but not anytime soon due to lack of free time.

This app is a personal project that I am creating for myself. I would be happy if it was useful to someone else, and I am always open to suggestions on how to improve it. Any help and constructive criticism is most welcome
